/**
 * Why the game's process (":game") ended, in one plain sentence for the launcher's notice (ExitWatch; pure Java: dm/tools/tests/test_android_exitnotice.py runs it on
 * the JVM). Three sources are combined: the run's exit record (last-exit.txt in the app's files: GameActivity writes "state=running" at the start and "state=stopped"
 * on Stop; the uncaught-exception handler appends "state=java", nxlaunch.c's signal handler "state=native", the host's return "state=host_exit"), Android's
 * ApplicationExitInfo for that process, and the end of the run's log (the host's "CRASH sig=", "FATAL" and "GPU hang" lines). Keys are "key=value" lines, the last of a
 * key wins (the record is only appended to).
