# NUP support (branch android-nup)

Play and prepare a game straight from one `.nup` file (github.com/a55uka/nup, SPEC.md at commit 92089de3, format 1.0-draft),
with no unpacking. The `.nup` is only ever read: it is the user's dump and is never modified. The rewritten code goes into the
pack as it does for a folder.

## The format in one paragraph

Superblock (0x80) at 0, then the TOC (packages, dirs, files, children, string pool; SHA-256 in the superblock), then the
blob region. A package is `base` (kind 0), `update` (1, one per version) or `addon` (2, own title ID); each has an
`exefs_dir` and a `romfs_dir` (0xFFFFFFFF = none). Each file is one extent, 16-byte aligned, codec 0 (raw) or 1 (one zstd
frame for the whole file, content size in the frame header). Equal files may share one extent. An update package holds a
full RomFS (as `updates/<version>/romfs` does in a folder dump): no layering is needed.

## Naming a package: `<file>.nup:<selector>`

Everywhere a path to a RomFS (or an ExeFS) is given, a `.nup` package is named as the file's path, a colon, and:

| selector | package |
|---|---|
| `base` | the base package |
| `update/<decimal version>` | the update of that NCM version, e.g. `update/458752` |
| `addon/<16 hex digits>` | the add-on of that title ID (lower case), e.g. `addon/040074a01bf13001` |

The path is split at the last `.nup:`. Without a selector (`game.nup`), the RomFS is the highest-version update's, or the
base's when there is none. A selector naming no package is an error.

A package stands where a package folder of a folder dump would (`base/`, `updates/<v>/`, `dlc/<tid>/<n>/`), and a path inside
it may follow the selector, as inside that folder: `game.nup:update/458752/romfs`, `game.nup:update/458752/exefs/main`,
`game.nup:addon/040074a01bf13001/romfs`. The selector's own form is fixed (`base`, `update/<digits>`, `addon/<16 hex>`), so
the rest after it is unambiguous. Tools take these wherever they take the matching folder path. The host's `DM_ROMFS` takes
`<file>.nup:<selector>/romfs` (also `<file>.nup:<selector>` and plain `<file>.nup`, both meaning that package's RomFS), and
`pack.tsv` writes the full `/romfs` form.

## Host (dm/host/hle_fs.c, dm/host/nup_image.h)

- `DM_ROMFS` may be `<file>.nup` or `<file>.nup:<selector>`. The mount reads the TOC, checks it, and maps the chosen
  package's `romfs_dir` subtree onto the same in-memory index a RomFS image (DMROMFS1) uses, so lookups, listings and
  sizes are shared code.
- Reads: a raw file is read with pread at its extent. A zstd file is decompressed whole into memory when the game opens
  it, held until it is closed, then kept in a least-recently-used cache of `DM_NUP_CACHE_MB` (default 128). No cache on
  disk: in Donkey Kong Bananza the compressed files are 5.6 GiB that zstd shrinks by only 13 %, so a disk cache would give
  back what compression saved; the largest is 53 MiB and only 8 are over 16 MiB (one decompresses in tens of ms).
- zstd: `DM_NUP_ZSTD` (android/host/CMakeLists.txt, the unit tests) links dm/third_party/zstd. The Mac and iOS hosts are
  built without it: raw files read, a compressed file fails to open with a red line.
- Tests: `make -C dm/host/tests GAME=<id> run` (t_fs "NUP container": a .nup written in C from the spec). Against a real
  dump: `build/t_nup_dump <file>.nup:<selector>/romfs <that package's RomFS folder>` reads every file through hle_fs.c and
  compares it (DKB update 458752: 77,342 files, 8.55 GiB, all equal; base and DLC too).
- `DM_AOC_DIR/<index>.nup` (a file or a symbolic link to the `.nup`): add-on content `<index>` is the addon package whose
  title ID's low 12 bits equal `<index>` (pack_android.py's index is `tid - app - 0x1000`, the same number). Checked
  before `<index>.img` and `<index>/`. The add-on list (`hle_misc.c` `aoc_load`) counts `<index>.nup` as it counts `<index>.img`
  (before 2026-11-08 it skipped it, so a `.nup` game's add-on was linked but not reported as owned).

## A .nup used where it is

Without All files access an Android app can open a file the user picked only through its provider, by a descriptor; no path
works (`/proc/self/fd/<n>` reopened by path is not reliable on every provider). So a `.nup` picked with the system file picker
(android/README.md, "A .nup used where it is") is read by descriptor everywhere:

- Host: a spec's file part may be `fd:<n>/<name>` in place of a path (`nup_image.h` `nup_fd_spec`, `nup_open_file`): descriptor
  `<n>`, which the launcher opened (`PickedNup.detachedFd`) and keeps for the process's life; each image opens its own duplicate
  (`F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC`), reads with pread only (the position the duplicates share never matters) and closes it with the image; a
  descriptor that is not open is refused. `<name>` is for messages. `DM_ROMFS=fd:<n>/<name>:update/<v>/romfs`; the add-on link
  `DM_AOC_DIR/<index>.nup` is a symbolic link whose target is `fd:<n>/<name>` (nothing is there: `aoc_dir` reads it with
  readlink). Tests: t_fs "NUP container" (an update and a zstd file through the descriptor, its position unmoved, the add-on
  link, a closed descriptor refused).
- Tools: `DM_NUP_FD=<fd>:<path>` (`nup.py` `fd_of`, `open_fd`, `stat`): that path, compared after realpath, is read through a
  duplicate of `<fd>` whether or not anything is there, so `pack_android.py`, `pack_dump.py` and `shader_split.py` take the
  stand-in path as any `.nup` path. The phone's packer sets it per run (`PackService`); empty means none. Tests: test_nup.py
  `Descriptor` (the trees, streams and mmap, pack_dump.scan, and pack_android.py's pack equal to the file's own).
- Launcher: `Nup.Source` (a channel read by position, its size, its cache key) for every read; `Nup.opener` (`PickedNup`,
  installed by `NxApp` in every process) answers for the stand-in paths `files/picked/<key>/<name>`. Tests: NupJvmTest
  `picked` (the stand-in read through an opener, its DM_ROMFS and add-on link in the host's form, a lost file).

## Tools (Python: dm/tools/nup.py and its users)

- `dm/tools/nup.py`: reader. Checks a `.nup` per SPEC §6.1 (TOC SHA-256 before any TOC value is used, bounds, no overlapping
  extents but shared ones, sorted acyclic directories; unknown codec, kind, flags refused), lists packages, resolves selectors,
  and gives walk / list / stat / read and seekable streams. zstd: in memory up to 64 MiB (a read near the start decodes only that far), streamed above that, a temp file in
  `$DM_TEMP` only when a caller needs a descriptor for mmap. CLI: `packages`, `ls`, `cat`, `verify`.
- `dm/tools/romfs.py` (`Path`, `open`, `os`, `mmap` for paths inside images) is the access layer: a path with `.nup:` goes to
  a NUP view, so `shader_split.py`, `romfs_image.py` and `pack_dump.py` (scan, pack_version, pack_dlc) take `.nup` paths with
  no code of their own. `<file>.nup:` with an empty selector is the container root (folders `base`, `update/<v>`,
  `addon/<tid>`); a path naming a missing package is not found.
- zstd module: `compression.zstd` (Python 3.14: bananative-env on the Mac, the phone's CPython 3.14.6), else
  `backports.zstd`; imported at the first compressed file, so a raw-only `.nup` needs none.
- The rewriter reads plain files: `pack_android.py` copies a NUP module into the pack's `.nup-src/<module>/` for
  `patch_nso.py` and deletes it after (`rewriter_src`). `nso.py` and the other `REWRITER` files are unchanged, so the rewrite
  key is the same for a folder and a `.nup` of it, and packs made before this branch keep their modules.
- `pack.tsv` written for a `.nup` game: `romfs` = `<name>.nup:update/<version>/romfs` (or `:base/romfs`), and each `aoc`
  line's path = `<name>.nup:addon/<tid>/romfs`, relative to the folder that holds the `.nup`. The pack goes to
  `<title ID>-work/android-pack` next to the `.nup`, as next to a game folder.
- A `.nup` has no `.listing` files (SPEC §6.3), so its file count differs from a folder dump's (DKB update: 77,342 against
  80,273); the shader split's output is the same.
- `dm/tools/nup_pack.py`: a small clean-room writer, for test fixtures (a folder dump → `.nup`), not for users.
- Tests: `python -m unittest dm/tools/tests/test_nup.py` (bananative-env). On DKB, `pack_android.py` from the folder and from
  the `.nup` (`--in-process`, the phone's path) give byte-identical modules, tables and keys; `shader_split.py` gives the
  same package and tables (22,852 shaders).

## App (android/app)

- The extension is lower case: tools and host split at `.nup:`; the app refuses `.NUP` with "rename it to .nup".
- Add game asks "a folder" or "a .nup file" (system file picker, turned into its /storage path with All files access; a
  document with no such path, from Recent or Downloads, and every pick without All files access, is used where it is:
  [A .nup used where it is](#a-nup-used-where-it-is)). A picked folder holding `.nup` files (or dump subfolders) adds
  all of them (`PackFind.gamesIn`; a title without a profile in this APK is named in the summary). adb: `--es game <file.nup>`, or
  `--es add_game <file.nup or folder>` for Add game's own path. A `.nup`'s pack is looked for beside it and in `<title ID>-work/<any name>`
  of its folder and up to three folders above it (`PackFind`).
- `Nup.java` reads the superblock and TOC (SHA-256 checked, cached by path, size and mtime), `Zstd.java` is a pure-Java zstd
  frame decoder (RFC 8878, no dictionaries) for main.npdm, NSO build IDs and the rewrite key check: the launcher process
  loads no native code.
- GameActivity: `DM_ROMFS` = the game's own `.nup` + pack.tsv's selector + `/romfs` (only the selector is taken, so a
  renamed `.nup` still plays; a pack made from a folder falls back to `update/<pack version>` or `base`). `DM_AOC_DIR/<index>.nup`
  links to the game's own `.nup` when it holds that add-on, else to the `.nup` the aoc row names, else the game's own.
- Prepare on the phone (PackService) passes `<N>` (the `.nup`) to pack_android.py and `<N>:update/<v>/romfs`,
  `<N>:update/<v>/exefs/main` (`<N>:base/…` for version 0) to shader_split.py. It takes any of three layouts (`DumpLayout`): the base alone with its ExeFS and RomFS (a game whose build is its base), an update alone that carries the whole game, or both; a version's ExeFS and RomFS are its own, else the base's, and the version is the one whose modules are a profile build, found by build ID wherever it is. A `.nup` of another build is refused with what it holds and the build this app supports. DumpCheck checks the TOC hash,
  the version's main / main.npdm / RomFS, each module's build ID and the profile's `romfs_check` rows (`RomfsCheck`: the RomFS is that version's data).
- Readiness: a "Game files" row per game (a `.nup` must open and pass its TOC hash).
- Tests: `NupJvmTest` (javac + java, no Gradle runner yet; see its header): 293 checks on a synthetic `.nup`, 30 on the
  real DKB one.

## Test data

Tested with a `040074A01BF12000` dump (base, update 458752, add-on `040074a01bf13001`) as an official `.nup` and as a folder,
and a `0400C3F00006E000` 1.8.0 dump (base only) as a `.nup` written by `dm/tools/nup_pack.py` (2026-11-05, on the phone: both
reach their level from the `.nup` with no Prepare). Dump folders and test `.nup` files belong on the dump drive, not in the
repository; a `.nup` is a full-size copy of a dump, so mind the free space before writing one.
